      <description>I thought it would be good to revisit my great 2020 plan from the start of the year and see the progress that I&amp;rsquo;ve made. I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;ve made reasonable progress, but not as much as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I put this partially down to my shifting interests - notably getting more and more interested in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <description>Ethereum 2.0 node running on my Raspberry Pi - I&amp;#39;ve still yet to read the book, but I thought these together would make a good photo op  After taking part in the Topaz testnet, I obviously had to take part in Ethereum 2.0&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; multi-client testnet ðŸ˜Š - hopefully the final testnet before mainnet launches.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time since my last update. Things that I&amp;rsquo;ve done since May -
 I completed a short course at City, University of London - Introduction to Data Analytics and Machine Learning with Python Attended an online webinar hosted by IBM on quantum computing - Throwing the dice with a Quantum Computer Set up another Ethereum 2.</description>

      <description>Things that Iâ€™ve done over the past couple of months.
  Wrote a tool that monitors changes to sitemaps. I needed something that would detect newly published webpages for archival capture. The Github repo is here.
  I started a short course at City, University of London - Introduction to Data Analytics and Machine Learning with Python.</description>

      <title>Ethereum 2.0 validator - Topaz Testnet</title>

      <description>Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly interested in blockchains/cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum - a blockchain famed for its executable smart contracts.
The project is to undergo a major upgrade over the coming years, resulting in Ethereum 2.0
The upgrade aims to address scalability issues of Ethereum 1.0 via &amp;lsquo;sharding&amp;rsquo; - which essentially means breaking up the blockchain into multiple blockchains.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading a book called The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation (Owens, T. 2018). While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound that exciting - I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying it. I like how the author highlights some important things to consider using some really interesting examples.
  Alexei Shulgin&amp;rsquo;s Form Art - aesthetic considerations, how web browsers display HTML changes over time, how important is the browser rendering?</description>

      <title>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a start on Brian Harveyâ€™s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs lectures - based on the book with the same name. I&amp;rsquo;m about 7 lectures in and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it so far. My only gripe is that the videos look like they were filmed in the 1980s - when they are actually from 2011.</description>

      <description>It has been a steady couple of months, despite the world going into lockdown over COVID-19.
I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been occupied with web archiving and digital preservation stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the Internet Archive&amp;rsquo;s brozzler crawler; using ExifTool to modify metadata; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing all sorts of scripts/tools to automate small tasks (I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of putting them together as a collection on GitHub).</description>

      <title>WARCing up the wrong tree - Part II</title>

      <description>A continuation of my WARCings.
Writing WARCs with warcio The following code logs into a website and uses warcio to write logged-in pages to a WARC file. This would be especially useful for capturing basic webpages / media files. It will have to be improved in order to capture embedded resources - this is probably relatively straightforward though.</description>

      <description>It has been a quite varied month.
  I attended two coding meetups:
  New Year&amp;rsquo;s Hyperledger @ PwC More London
  IBM Code London - Audio Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks @ Techspace Shoreditch
    I built a blockchain using Python, more on that here</description>
