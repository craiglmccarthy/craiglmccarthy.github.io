      <description>November saw me finishing Make Your Own Neural Network (Rashid, 2016), making good progress with the freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, and attending my first coding meetup with London Python.
Make Your Own Neural Network was a great read - it definitely demystified the goings on in neural networks.</description>

      <description>It was a fairly quiet month on the coding front. The first half of the month was largely taken up by a visit to Poland - to the cities of Krakow and Warsaw. I had a great time and I definitely had my fair share of pierogi.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the progress that I made in August -</description>

      <description>This month mostly consisted of readings. I made my way through HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites (Duckett, 2011), JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development (Duckett, 2013), and I started Python for Data Analysis (McKinney, 2017).
The web development books served as both a refresher (I&amp;rsquo;ve already got quite a bit of experience regarding HTML and CSS) and a primer for the freeCodeCamp courses that I hope to start in August.</description>
