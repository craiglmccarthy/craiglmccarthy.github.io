      <description>I decided to build my site using Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve also transferred my posts from my previous Github/Jekyll powered blog. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that Jekyll is built for a dying language - Ruby.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with my site. Hugo is nice and easy to work with and it allows for endless customisation.</description>
