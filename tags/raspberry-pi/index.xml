      <description>Ethereum 2.0 node running on my Raspberry Pi - I&amp;#39;ve still yet to read the book, but I thought these together would make a good photo op  After taking part in the Topaz testnet, I obviously had to take part in Ethereum 2.0&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; multi-client testnet ðŸ˜Š - hopefully the final testnet before mainnet launches.</description>

      <description>November saw me finishing Make Your Own Neural Network (Rashid, 2016), making good progress with the freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, and attending my first coding meetup with London Python.
Make Your Own Neural Network was a great read - it definitely demystified the goings on in neural networks.</description>

      <description>My greatest achievement of October was that I finally managed to finish the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, the Github repository is available here. It took a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, though towards the end I think I had got my workflows figured out. Next stop - the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.</description>
