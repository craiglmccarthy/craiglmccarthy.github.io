      <description>I thought it would be good to revisit my great 2020 plan from the start of the year and see the progress that I&amp;rsquo;ve made. I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;ve made reasonable progress, but not as much as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I put this partially down to my shifting interests - notably getting more and more interested in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time since my last update. Things that I&amp;rsquo;ve done since May -
 I completed a short course at City, University of London - Introduction to Data Analytics and Machine Learning with Python Attended an online webinar hosted by IBM on quantum computing - Throwing the dice with a Quantum Computer Set up another Ethereum 2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading a book called The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation (Owens, T. 2018). While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound that exciting - I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying it. I like how the author highlights some important things to consider using some really interesting examples.
  Alexei Shulgin&amp;rsquo;s Form Art - aesthetic considerations, how web browsers display HTML changes over time, how important is the browser rendering?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a start on Brian Harveyâ€™s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs lectures - based on the book with the same name. I&amp;rsquo;m about 7 lectures in and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it so far. My only gripe is that the videos look like they were filmed in the 1980s - when they are actually from 2011.</description>

      <description>It has been a steady couple of months, despite the world going into lockdown over COVID-19.
I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been occupied with web archiving and digital preservation stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the Internet Archive&amp;rsquo;s brozzler crawler; using ExifTool to modify metadata; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing all sorts of scripts/tools to automate small tasks (I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of putting them together as a collection on GitHub).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an outline of what I&amp;rsquo;d like to achieve throughout 2020.
Math I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to brush up on my math in preparation for a machine learning course that I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting in April.
 Complete Data Science Math Skills - Duke University Complete Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization - Imperial College London Go through the 3Blue1Brown playlists Do some Khan Academy courses if necessary (Algebra I, Precalculus, Statistics &amp;amp; Probability, Calculus I, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear Algebra)  Data Science Data Science-esque things took a back seat towards the end of last year (though I was using Juypter Notebooks/pandas here and there), but I&amp;rsquo;m going to be getting back into it.</description>

      <description>My greatest achievement of October was that I finally managed to finish the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, the Github repository is available here. It took a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, though towards the end I think I had got my workflows figured out. Next stop - the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.</description>

      <description>This month was a bit busier than the previous month.
I have decided to take a break from DataCamp and have decided to hit up the books instead. I&amp;rsquo;ll return to DataCamp after I&amp;rsquo;ve finished reading -
 Python for Data Analysis (McKinney, 2017) Data Science from Scratch (Grus, 2019)  I started to watch the 2019 CS50 lectures from Harvard University, CS50 being an introductory computer science course.</description>
