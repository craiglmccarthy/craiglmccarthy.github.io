      <description>I thought it would be good to revisit my great 2020 plan from the start of the year and see the progress that I&amp;rsquo;ve made. I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;ve made reasonable progress, but not as much as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I put this partially down to my shifting interests - notably getting more and more interested in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <description>Things that Iâ€™ve done over the past couple of months.
  Wrote a tool that monitors changes to sitemaps. I needed something that would detect newly published webpages for archival capture. The Github repo is here.
  I started a short course at City, University of London - Introduction to Data Analytics and Machine Learning with Python.</description>

      <description>It has been a quite varied month.
  I attended two coding meetups:
  New Year&amp;rsquo;s Hyperledger @ PwC More London
  IBM Code London - Audio Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks @ Techspace Shoreditch
    I built a blockchain using Python, more on that here</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s an outline of what I&amp;rsquo;d like to achieve throughout 2020.
Math I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to brush up on my math in preparation for a machine learning course that I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting in April.
 Complete Data Science Math Skills - Duke University Complete Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization - Imperial College London Go through the 3Blue1Brown playlists Do some Khan Academy courses if necessary (Algebra I, Precalculus, Statistics &amp;amp; Probability, Calculus I, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear Algebra)  Data Science Data Science-esque things took a back seat towards the end of last year (though I was using Juypter Notebooks/pandas here and there), but I&amp;rsquo;m going to be getting back into it.</description>

      <description>November saw me finishing Make Your Own Neural Network (Rashid, 2016), making good progress with the freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, and attending my first coding meetup with London Python.
Make Your Own Neural Network was a great read - it definitely demystified the goings on in neural networks.</description>
