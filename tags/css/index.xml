      <description>I decided to build my site using Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;ve also transferred my posts from my previous Github/Jekyll powered blog. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that Jekyll is built for a dying language - Ruby.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with my site. Hugo is nice and easy to work with and it allows for endless customisation.</description>

      <description>My greatest achievement of October was that I finally managed to finish the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification, the Github repository is available here. It took a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, though towards the end I think I had got my workflows figured out. Next stop - the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.</description>

      <description>It was a fairly quiet month on the coding front. The first half of the month was largely taken up by a visit to Poland - to the cities of Krakow and Warsaw. I had a great time and I definitely had my fair share of pierogi.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the progress that I made in August -</description>

      <description>This month mostly consisted of readings. I made my way through HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites (Duckett, 2011), JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development (Duckett, 2013), and I started Python for Data Analysis (McKinney, 2017).
The web development books served as both a refresher (I&amp;rsquo;ve already got quite a bit of experience regarding HTML and CSS) and a primer for the freeCodeCamp courses that I hope to start in August.</description>
