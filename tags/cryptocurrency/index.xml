      <description>Things that Iâ€™ve done over the past couple of months.
  Wrote a tool that monitors changes to sitemaps. I needed something that would detect newly published webpages for archival capture. The Github repo is here.
  I started a short course at City, University of London - Introduction to Data Analytics and Machine Learning with Python.</description>

      <description>Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly interested in blockchains/cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum - a blockchain famed for its executable smart contracts.
The project is to undergo a major upgrade over the coming years, resulting in Ethereum 2.0
The upgrade aims to address scalability issues of Ethereum 1.0 via &amp;lsquo;sharding&amp;rsquo; - which essentially means breaking up the blockchain into multiple blockchains.</description>

      <description>I decided to have another look into blockchain - this time by building one. I found this excellent medium article - https://medium.com/@vanflymen/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46 which goes through the process of building one in Python. The blockchain that I built is available here - I&amp;rsquo;ve added some instructions about how to use it using HTTPie.</description>

      <description>This month was a bit busier than the previous month.
I have decided to take a break from DataCamp and have decided to hit up the books instead. I&amp;rsquo;ll return to DataCamp after I&amp;rsquo;ve finished reading -
 Python for Data Analysis (McKinney, 2017) Data Science from Scratch (Grus, 2019)  I started to watch the 2019 CS50 lectures from Harvard University, CS50 being an introductory computer science course.</description>

      <description>This month I got to grips with the use of virtual environments and the integration of Git in Visual Studio Code. I also set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux so that I can use Bash.
I put some more work into the GUI data entry automation project - it is now complete and I have built it into a windows executable via pyinstaller.</description>
